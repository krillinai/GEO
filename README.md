## 🧩 What is this document about

This repository is a **comprehensive technical and strategic guide** to **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** — the new discipline of making your brand *visible, credible, and citable* in AI-generated answers.  

Unlike traditional SEO, which focuses on ranking on search engines like Google, **GEO focuses on visibility inside AI systems** — such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity — that now summarize the web instead of listing links.

This documentation blends **strategy, data, and implementation**:
- 🧠 **Foundational concepts** — Understanding GEO and how AI search works  
- 🧩 **Content frameworks** — Structuring information for AI comprehension and citation  
- ⚙️ **Technical implementation** — Schema.org, structured data, sitemaps, and markup  
- 🚀 **Strategic execution** — Authority building, multi-platform GEO, and prompt-based discovery  
- 📊 **Measurement & analytics** — Visibility, menthion, citation share, sentiment  

Each chapter is both **educational and actionable** — think of this as a *whitepaper for understanding* and a *playbook for execution*.
