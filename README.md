## 🧩 What This Document Is
This repository is a **comprehensive technical and strategic guide** to  **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** — the emerging discipline that helps your brand gain visibility, credibility, and citations within AI-generated answers. Unlike traditional SEO, GEO focuses on **how AI systems (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, etc.) discover, interpret, and reference information** across the web.

This document combines:
- 📖 **Foundational concepts** — What GEO is, and why it matters  
- ⚙️ **Technical implementation** — Schema, structured data, and AI-friendly markup  
- 🎯 **Strategic frameworks** — Topic clustering, citation optimization, multi-platform GEO  
- 📊 **Measurement systems** — Visibility metrics, citation share, sentiment, ROI tracking  

Each chapter is both **educational and actionable** — you can treat this as a whitepaper *and* as a step-by-step playbook for your marketing or AI growth team.
