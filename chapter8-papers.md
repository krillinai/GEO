## 8.1 Relevant Papers & Reports on GEO and AI-Search Visibility

- [**GEO: Generative Engine Optimization**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09735) – Pranjal Aggarwal, Vishvak Murahari, Tanmay Rajpurohit, Ashwin Kalyan, Karthik Narasimhan, Ameet Deshpande. Nov 2023.  
  Introduces GEO as the first formal framework for optimizing content visibility in generative engines (LLM-based search/answer systems). Presents GEO-bench, a large query benchmark, and reports up to ~40% visibility boost using GEO methods. 

- [**Manipulating Large Language Models to Increase Product Visibility**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07981) – Aounon Kumar, Himabindu Lakkaraju. Apr 2024.  
  Examines how adding strategic text sequences (STS) to product pages changes LLM recommendations; shows that manipulation can significantly increase a product’s likelihood of being top-recommended by LLMs.

- [**Role-Augmented Intent-Driven Generative Search Engine Optimization**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11158) – Xiaolu Chen, Haojie Wu, Jie Bao, Zhen Chen, Yong Liao, Hu Huang. Aug 2025.  
  Proposes a structured method (G-SEO) tailored for generative search environments: models search intent via role/intent augmentation, extends GEO datasets, and presents fine-grained evaluation rubric (G-Eval 2.0).

- [**Yext Research: 86% of AI Citations Come from Brand-Controlled Sources**](https://investors.yext.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/376/yext-research-86-of-ai-citations-come-from-brand-managed) – Oct 2025.  
  Analysis of 6.8 million AI citations across ChatGPT, Gemini & Perplexity finds that 86% originate from brand-owned or brand-controlled domains, highlighting the importance of structured, authoritative content for GEO. 

- [**AI Search Optimization: Data Finds Brand Mentions Improve Visibility**](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/ai-search-engines-often-cite-third-party-content-study-finds/540692/) – Search Engine Journal, Feb 2025.  
  Study shows how AI search engines source citations and how brand mentions/third-party content impact visibility in generative answers.
