## What is GEO?

**GEO** is the practice of making your brand **visible, credible, and citable** within AI-generated responses.  
It’s not about chasing keywords or backlinks anymore — it’s about ensuring that when tools like ChatGPT or Bard respond to users, **your brand is part of the story**.

GEO helps AI models **understand, verify, and confidently include** your content as a trustworthy source.

## Why GEO Matters

- **Traditional rankings** no longer guarantee visibility.  
- **AI engines summarize**, not list — they select only a few trusted sources.  
- **Citations are the new clicks** — being referenced means being found.  
- **Authority now lives inside AI models**, not just on the web.

> GEO ensures your brand is **discoverable, credible, and relevant** in the age of AI-powered discovery.
