# Chapter 3: Key Definitions and Metrics

Before we discuss writing techniques and AI-friendly content structures,  it’s crucial to understand the **core definitions and metrics** that define success in Generative Engine Optimization (GEO).

---

### 🧭 Prompt
A **prompt** is a user’s query or request to an AI system.  
In GEO, prompts replace traditional keywords — they represent **how users naturally ask questions**.  
> Example: “What are the best infrared gas sensors for industrial use?”

---

### 📚 Citation
A **citation** is when an AI system explicitly references or links to your content inside a generated answer.  
It is the clearest signal of **trust and authority** — showing the model relied on your material as part of its reasoning process.  
> Example: “   ”

---

### 💬 Mention
A **mention** occurs when your brand or product is named within an AI-generated response,  even without a hyperlink.  
Mentions build **brand familiarity** across conversational interfaces —  they’re visibility without attribution.

---

### 🔗 Visibility
**Visibility** measures how often your brand appears in AI-generated answers related to your domain.  
It is the GEO equivalent of SEO ranking, but instead of positions on a results page,  it tracks **presence in answers**.

---

### 💡 Sentiment
**Sentiment** reflects the tone and context of how your brand appears in AI-generated outputs —  positive, neutral, or negative.  
Sentiment shapes how audiences perceive your credibility and authority through AI narratives.

---

### 🧱 Trust Signal
A **trust signal** is any attribute that helps AI engines verify your reliability.  
Typical examples include:  
- Authorship and expert attribution  
- Structured data (Schema.org, JSON-LD)  
- Verifiable references and statistics  
- Consistent brand identity across domains

> 🧭 *Goal:* Strengthen every trust signal to improve the likelihood of being cited by AI systems.

### 📊 Core GEO Metrics

| **Metric** | **Description** | **Example / Application** |
|:------------|:----------------|:---------------------------|
| **Prompt Coverage** | % of key AI prompts in which your brand or content appears | “Beili Sensors” appears in 45% of methane-sensor-related queries |
| **Citation Share** | Share of total citations referencing your content vs. competitors | 3 of 10 Perplexity answers cite your site |
| **Visibility Score** | Composite index of mentions + citations + sentiment | 0.72 (↑ from 0.65 last quarter) |
| **Authority Weight** | AI trust score derived from structured data and cross-source consistency | High = model more likely to reuse your content |
| **Sentiment Index** | Weighted measure of positive vs. negative references | +0.42 indicates generally favorable mentions |
| **Trust Density** | Average number of verifiable data points per 1,000 words of content | 3.8 trust elements / 1k words |
| **Freshness Ratio** | % of AI citations referencing content updated within 12 months | 68% freshness = strong recency signal |

> 💬 *In short:*  
> GEO performance depends on two forces — **language fit (definitions)** and **data proof (metrics)**.  
> Understand both, and you control how AI engines see and cite your brand.
